## [1.8]

### Added 

- Added initial Android and Ios App based on flutter. You can download from Play Store here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.elblogbruno.notion_ai_my_mind
- Disclaimer : I won't be releasing the app on the Apple App Store, as I don't have an Apple Developer Account either Mac OS based computer.

### Fixed

- Fixed server issues to be able to add images by posting, so I could add local images from phone.

## [1.7]

### Added 

- You can log in with email and password. (You need to enable a password on notion website settings.) For security, each time you reload the server you need to log in again. This is because email and password is not saved anywhere. You hear correctly.
- New revamped design and logic of the extension. Now its nicer, and shows always, even adding frome context menu. If you liked it, be careful with this update, you'll love it. 

### Fixed

- Fixed server issues adding callback capabilities. Before some websites images were not added due to timeouts.

## Project Philosophy.

The idea is to have an extension on the browser, and app on android and Ios, allowing you to add whatever you find on the web in your "Mind".
Also, adding image and article tagging capabilities thanks to AI, so you can simply search on your "Mind" for what you remember.

Right now, there's a working but work in progress Python Local Server, that receives all the data from the extension and the app, and publishes it to Notion. So it is 100% open source and fully private!

### Chromium users
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/notion-ai-my-mind/eaheecglpekjjlegffodbfhbhdmnjaph?hl=es&authuser=0 the chromium browsers such as google chrome or microsoft edge can install the extension from the store!
### Firefox users
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/notion-ai-my-mind/ firefox users can install the extension from the store!

## Installing

### Prerequisites

Right now there is no official way of accessing the Notion API but there is a little work-around to get your credentials.
You need to have an account on [Notion.so](https://notion.so/) and need to be logged in your browser.

### Getting your credentials

On to the chrome extension settings, you can get your needed token_v2! It is necessary for the Python server. (Hidden in the photo for obvious reasons)         |  For AI Tagging you need to create a free account at [Clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com/) and create an Application named whatever you want and get the API key.
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:

TokenV2 is updated automatically when it changes (it occurs when you log out of notion or it expires), so Notion AI My Mind should always work. â˜» You can also change it manually of course.
### Love to try it?

To install the python server, fire up your linux distributed machine and run this command.
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elblogbruno/NotionAI-MyMind/master/setup.sh && sudo sh setup.sh

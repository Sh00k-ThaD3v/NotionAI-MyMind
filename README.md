## Project Philosophy.

The idea is to have an extension on the browser, and app on android and Ios, allowing you to add whatever you find on the web in your "Mind".
Also, adding image and article tagging capabilities thanks to AI, so you can simply search on your "Mind" for what you remember.

Right now, there's a working Python Local Server, that receives all the data from the extension and the app, and publishes it to Notion. So it is 100% open source and fully private!
### Extensions
### Chromium users
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/notion-ai-my-mind/eaheecglpekjjlegffodbfhbhdmnjaph?hl=es&authuser=0 the chromium browsers such as google chrome or microsoft edge can install the extension from the store!
### Firefox users
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/notion-ai-my-mind/ firefox users can install the extension from the store!
### Android and Ios users

Users can install the android app from android store
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.elblogbruno.notion_ai_my_mind

I won't be releasing the app on the Apple App Store, as I don't have an Apple Developer Account either Mac OS based computer.
Meanwhile, you can clone the flutter project and build the app yourself.
